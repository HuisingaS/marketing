            Just as you probably know your hometown or city like the back of your hand, living abroad allows individuals the chance to learn foreign towns just the same. There may be a place you have always wanted to go, or a culture that you have been interested. Living abroad allows you to become fully emerged in the other culture and even gives you the chance to live like the locals.
